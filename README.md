# Wordy Words (working title)

## Introduction

This is a fun word game where you are given a 4-5 letter long word to guess in 6 tries. If you solve it, you will get more tries to solve the larger word it's a part of. For example, the first word may be `other`, with the full word being psych`other`apist.

More coming soon!
